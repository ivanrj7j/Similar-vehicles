# Image Similarity AI Model

![Project Logo](image.jpeg) (_Image Generated using bing ai_)

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to develop an AI model that can determine the most similar images within a given dataset. This is achieved by first training a classification model on the dataset. After successfully training the model, I use the output from the last hidden layer as a vector representation of each image. By employing cosine similarity, I can then compare these vectors to find the most similar images in the dataset.

**Please note that this project is purely a concept, and there is a possibility that it might not achieve the desired results**. My intention is to explore the concept and gain valuable insights, regardless of the final outcome.

The insights gained from this attempt, even if the project does not succeed, will be valuable for future iterations and developments in image comparison and similarity analysis. I welcome other researchers and developers to join me in this exploratory journey, as we learn from both successes and failures.

I hope this concept will inspire curiosity and creativity among the AI community. Should you choose to be a part of this exciting endeavor, I welcome your contributions and look forward to working together.

_Thank you for your interest in my Image Similarity AI Model project, and let's embark on this challenging yet rewarding exploration together!_
